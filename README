This directory contains lots of dotfiles. It's all shell environment and
window manager customization type stuff.

NOTE: I'm moving this system from Subversion to git. (As soon as I figure out
how git works.)

Running "./update" will push everything here to your $HOME. It will back up your
existing crap in a tarball.

Running "./downdate" will copy your current files back into this directory so you
may commit them back to the svn repository.
